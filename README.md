 ## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project is organized into its own subdirectory. Inside each folder, you will typically find:

- `.sql` files – containing schema definitions, data dumps, or both.
- `.db` files – SQLite or other database formats, where applicable.
- `README.md` (optional) – explaining details of the backup, restoration instructions, or metadata.
